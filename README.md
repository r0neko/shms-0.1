# S.H.M.S Hub Software - version 0.1-ALPHA

This is the first version of the S.H.M.S. Hub Firmware Code. Please note that this is this the first version that has many problems, like memory leaks and others. Please note also that there is a second version of this app, which now is more stable and it's rewritten in C++(with parts still in C).

# How to build?

You must first run ./configure, make RF24 library for the Pi, then `make` the SHMS app...

# Please note that building may fail. I am not providing any support for this, as it is an discontinued version. :))

# Target hardware

Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian Stretch and nRF24L01+.
